# Iceman Media

Iceman Media is my personal photography website, but it's not only an introductory site. In the hopefully near future, when the website will be finished it will offer a gallery for the ones who want to see my hobby and work, but also it will be a showroom for people who want to be my customer and wish to receive a full website for their own or company with self made professional photography and unique design.

## Features

-__Typography and Color scheme__

__Note: The font has been changed to Papyrus for compatibility reasons.__<br>
I wanted to go simple yet stylish on the design.<br>
The whole website originally used the font (cursive) and the color scheme is basically tan (#E4DCD1) and black (#000000).
Has a black brick background and a hint of (aqua) resembling "ice" to spice up some parts (see "send it" button).


### Existing features

-__Header as navigation bar__
* Includes four links total. 
    - The name is directs to the top of the first page from any other page.
    - The "Projects" takes the user to the corresponding part of the first page.
    - The "Gallery" is the second page of the website.
    - The third page is the "Contact me"
* All links are responsive and consistent on all four pages, plus on the "Thank You" page (which can be seen through filling out the contact form).
- * Changed the header nav bar later in my development as my original plan was responsive, but I was not satisfied with the outcome.

| Header Bar : Mobile |
| ------- |
| ![Mobile-header](assets/media/mobile-header.png) |
    
    
-__Header part 2__
* Below the header, a small section contains:
    - A logo (made by me using [Canva-logo-creator](https://www.canva.com)).
    - A welcome message.
    - A short quote from a famous photographer.

![Welcome-Logo](assets/media/welcome-logo.png)

-__The introduction section__
* The "About me" section contains a short introduction, hence the title.
* It also has two link to two separate Instagram profiles as my main reaching point for all media. Basically Instagram centers most of my media, therefore I code this section to center the links.
* Both links styled as a button, and works like a normal link would. Also opens in a new tab. Although the links are not blue, nor will turn purple after visit.

![About-me](assets/media/about-me.png)

* Below this a framed picture of me can be found.

![Intro-pic](assets/media/intro-pic.png)

-__Ingredients__
* This section is just short useful filler.
* Ingredients for good photos and videos

![Ingredients](assets/media/ingredients.png)

-__Projects__
* This section is the second big part of the first page. Although now only is a short summary of what I am doing and what will be doing.
* The section contains three dropdowns so the sections inside are playful/engaging and well visible separately. Specially on smaller screens.

| Projects dropdown closed |

| Projects dropdown opened |

| ![Projects-opened](assets/media/projects-opened.png) |

-__Gallery__
* The gallery is the second page.
* Two sections: "Pictures" and "Videos"

| Gallery: Pictures section |
| ------- |
| ![Gallery-pictures](assets/media/gallery-pictures.png) |

| Gallery: Tablet screen |
| ------- |
| ![Gallery-tablet](assets/media/tablet-gallery.png) |

| Gallery: Mobile screen |
| ------- |
| ![Gallery-mobile](assets/media/mobile-gallery.png) |

* Pictures are presented large, even larger "on hover" and can be opened full size "on click".

![Gallery-pics-onhover](assets/media/gallery-pictures-onhover.png)

* Pictures are linked from an external photoshare website, so they can be viewed full size, and can be downloaded.
* Videos are linked straight from youtube, therefore can be viewed in all sizes, on all devices with full control and doesn't slows down the website.
    - Also another reason for youtube links: Videos can be found on my personal youtube channel.

![Gallery-videos](assets/media/gallery-videos.png)

-__Contact me__
* This is the third page. Named as it is.
* Basically an enquiry/contact form.
* Contains: name, email, number, message and a submit button.

| Contact Form |
| ------- |
| ![Contact-form](assets/media/contact-form.png) |

| Contact Form on mobile |
| ------- |
| ![Contact-form-mobile](assets/media/mobile-contact-form.png) |

* All data are required. After successful filling a "Thank You" page appears.

![Thank-You-page](assets/media/thank-you-page.png)

-__Footer__
* The footer in my case is large to attract attention to my other links (only Facebook and twitter/X , because Instagram is in the "About me" section and Youtube will be in the Videos section).
* Relevant copyrights, names and dates.

![Footer](assets/media/footer.png)

-__Top of the page button__
* The website does have a "Go to the top" button. Named "Up Top". It fulfills it's purpose, although I placed unconventionally to the left side as in the future I would like to give the option to go to the top with a click, but I don't wish to encourage it, so the user surely will see everything I offer.

![Up-top-button](assets/media/up-top-button.png)

-__Features left to implement__
* Projects section will be longer and well presented with pictures about what will I be doing.
* Gallery will be expanded to more sections (Websites will be added). Pictures will be sectioned to themes. Sizes will be changed accordingly. Websites section will probably hold links to all my work.
* Contact here section will contain actual contact info. Also will be other sections separating: contact, sign up and requests.

### Solved Bugs

|No.|Bug| Solution|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
|1.|First contact form idea was written in a way, that could not be properly used with different screen sizes.|Changed the contact form completely to a more useful format.|
|2.|Original font I used (cursive) could not be used with Apple products. Iphone, Ipad displayed different font.|I changed the font to (papyrus). Now all platform can show it. And I actually like it more.|
|3.|Original header I used could not be made for responsive design at all|I recoded a more simple design that works well on different screensizes.|

### Unsolved Bugs

The page has only one unsolved bug. At the "Videos" section the video itself goes a little bit out of the screen on phone only and only when the phone is in vertical position.

## Credits

### Used Code

For the code writing I was following the learning material from CodeInstitute of course. But also when something was a bit unclear I took help from [w3schools](www.w3schools.com).
When I needed more help I was browsing [stackoverflow](www.stackoverflow.com)

### Content/Images/Videos

* As this website is my own introductory site all content is written by me.
* As well as all pictures is photographed and edited by me.
* Just like the video as well.
